# Financial-Insights-Application
I created this as an internship project for Prosperity Networks using python

I used API's and Webscraping in order to retrieve this data. The libraries I used are requests(to request data from API's), pandas(data manipulation/organization), matplotlib(graphing), beautifulsoup(webscraping), tkinter(GUI)
